### Cut from Digital Elec

##### from Week 2 homework
- Pay particular attention to section 
		_Code 3: Generating a sound with a button_ and 
		_Code 4: Sounds depending on different keys_ 
		in the second resource.
  - Build the circuit described in section
		_Code 4: Sounds depending on different keys_ of the second 
		Arduino Tone Resource in
		[resources](https://github.com/loopstick/ResourcesForClasses).
		and verify that it works properly.
	
##### Cut from Week 4	
	- Processing
		- Install [Processing](http://processing.org)
		- If necessary, review Processing e.g. the notes for
			[this](http://teachmetomake.com/wordpress/cca-programming-for-art-and-design-fall-2015)
			class or some other place (Daniel Shiffman's videos are usually excellent)
		- Install the minim library. In Processing:
			- go to Sketch -> Import Library -> Add Library
			- type _minim_ in the filter
			- Select _minim_
			- Click _Install_
		- [Here](examples/minimalMinimSine/minimalMinimSine.pde) is the minimal Minim example we looked at in class
		- [Here](examples/minimalMinimSineMouse/minimalMinimSineMouse.pde) is
			another simple example, showing how to vary the pitch based on the position of the mouse
		- [Here](examples/arduinoMinimProcessing/arduinoMinimProcessing.pde) is the example we worked on in class which takes numbers from
			Arduino and uses them to set the frequency of the sine wave.
			If you are going to use a sensor to control sounds generated by Minim it
			is vital that you understand this example.
			
		- If you are creating complex sounds, look at some of the minim examples
			e.g. File -> Examples -> Contributed Libraries -> Minim -> Synthesis
			such as _defaultInstrumentExample_ which demonstrates the built-in
			default instrument and _compositionExample_ which has
			lots of different instruments for you to chose. You will have to extract
			the relevant parts to your program.
			
	- Michael's homework: Create a version of arduinoMinimProcessing which reads
  from two sensors
  
   [theremin example](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/Digital-Electronics-Spring-2017/blob/master/examples/theremin/theremin.ino)

#### Cut from Week 5
		- [_arduinoMinimProcessing2Sensors_]
		(examples/arduinoMinimProcessing2Sensors/arduinoMinimProcessing2Sensors.pde)
		example similar to the one we looked at last week with 
		the added feature that it reads from two sensors
