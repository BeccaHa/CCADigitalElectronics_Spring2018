## Midterm Project Documentation Example 

   - written description of your concept (this can be taken from your original project proposal)
   
### Harvey - the Shy Robot

#### Concept: Create a shy robot. 

I'm not sure yet what that means so for the first few iterations the focus of the project will be getting basic functionality working.
I decided to base the project on a design published in Make Magazine 61

    - drawing of your initial concept
    - picture of the first iteration
    - video of your working project (upload to YouTube and post a link)
    - code (or a written description of what the code should do, if it's not yet working)
    - schematic showing the relevant connections from Arduino to sensors and output devices: hand-drawn or [Fritzing](http:fritzing.org)
  - Write a concept proposal for your final project
    - Your final project can be a fuly developed iteration of your midterm project incorporating "nice to have" functionality from the initial concept or additional functionality suggested by the first iteration.
      - OR
    - a new project, substantially more complex than the exercises you've done so far.
     
     
- from Final Project Documentation
	- Describe goals of project briefly
	- Describe how, from a technical point of view, your choice of hardware
		and software achieves that goal
	- Accurate schematic
	- Parts list (major or unique parts, not LEDs, wire, etc.)
	- A few pictures of overall project plus some close ups of the electronics
		and any mechanism (cellphone is fine) 
	- A short video (cellphone is fine) of the operational project
	- Program(s) must be well commented 
		- Each variable must have a meaningful name
		- Each section (function, code block, loop, whatever) must be explained
		- All unused variables and code must be removed (debugging code
			commented out may remain)
